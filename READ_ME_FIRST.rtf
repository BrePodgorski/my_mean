\f0\fs24 \cf0 I know this is not the exam you gave me to do. However, the trivia one\'85. I couldn\'92t figure it out. So I decided I was going to submit something that I could do in order for me to have finally submitted something on this damn exam. Just wanted to end on a good note.\
You don\'92t need to tell me I failed, trust me I know! I just had to go rogue so I could feel good about the way I ended this program before leaving :)\
Thanks for everything!\
